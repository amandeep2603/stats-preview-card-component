## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned
This is my first frontend challenge after completing css tutorial from youtube. I have learned couple of new things like
how to add colour in  image , how to make responsive website etc. Though website is not fully responsive . But in next challenge 
definately improve myself. 

``` css
.myimg{
  background-blend-mode:multiply;
  background-color:violet;
  background-image:url();

}

```




### Continued development

Yeah, currently I'm more focusing on responsive webdesign and how to and when to apply flexbox amd grid . I'm still not comfortable in responsive design.
